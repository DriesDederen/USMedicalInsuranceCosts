# USMedicalInsuranceCosts
A CodeCademy project

Did not learn pandas yet, but was in a call with a friend who knows Python and gave me a quick introduction to pandas as I was making this project in a very inefficient way.

Turned out that I really like pandas! :)))

Game plan to solve this project:

1.Goals
  1. Average age of the patients in the dataset
  2. Analyze where majority of the individuals come from
  3. Look at the different costs between smokers vs non-smokers
  4. Figure out what the average age is for someone who has at least one child this dataset  
3. Gather data
4. Analytical steps
